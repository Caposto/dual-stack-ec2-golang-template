# Dualstack EC2 Instance Template in Golang

# TODO: LICENSE

This project is inspired by Jan Schaumman's blog post: [Creating AWS IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack EC2 Instances](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/ec2-ipv6.html).

With this code, a user should be able to fill in some infromation in a yaml file, and than use the AWS CDK to deploy theproper AWS services into a certain region. Once those resources are deployed, the user will be able to create a dual stack EC2 instance in that region that can use both IPv4 and IPv6.
